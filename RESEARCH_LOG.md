How to make a decision helping assistant that doest use ai

(ChatGPT)
my topic is Cardamom Farmer Assistant. The Assit will help the user on deciding: 
>Irrigation
>Soil PH and Nutrition
>Labour
>Fertilizer And Pesticides
>Shade Requirement For Cardamom and Basic Requirements
>Different types of cardamom plant

what are the diferent decision engine methods that i can create

Help you choose the best method for each of your 6 modules

Can from tommorow can we start making module by module


Day 2

(ChatGPT)
our system accepts questions from user know like whats the best iirigigation method and how is it better

how will it handle when u say that he has only 1 plant and which irrigation is better

can we decide it in a way that it itself will ask the needed information when it needs them to calculate

we can add a gemini api for information fetching and understanding but not for data processing

should the input also contain details that could affect all the modules

so does it also answer when i ask about soil ph in initial question

Do you want A) One single unified conversation loop OR B) Each module completely independent (simpler but less elegant)? explain

generate the diagram of the architecture and its working

Does this architecture cover all the cases or do u have any suggestions

The improvements that we will do are 
Add an Input Validation Layer Persistent Memory Decision with option to delete 
Add Explainability Breakdown Module add explaination if user asks 
Add Sensitivity Analysis that also suggest things 
Is this all possible

generate picture architecture diagram including these layers  
generate picture all the architecture working and everything
