Day 1

i am starting to do the project and i  decided that i should do the decision making assitant on the field of agriculture as my family income comes from it.so after searching on internet for a topic and finally by my father's opinion i have finalised my topic is Cardamom Farmer Assistant.
The Assitant will help the user on deciding:
>Irrigation
>Soil PH and Nutrition
>Labour
>Fertilizer And Pesticides
>Shade Requirement For Cardamom and Basic Requirements
>Different types of cardamom plant

i dont know to create the model so i asked chatgpt how to do it and it said i have to create a decision engine that will help in deciding which will help in making better decision for the farmer.Each property should have a decision engine on it own as every property is not same.The suggested ways are:
Irrigation	Hybrid (Rule + Weighted)	
Soil pH & Nutrition	(Rule-Based)	
Labour	(Weighted Scoring)
Fertilizer & Pesticide	(Weighted + Risk)	
Shade	(Rule + Light Scoring)	
Variety Selection	(Weighted Scoring)
i asked if we can start creating it module by module it said we can first build a solid base of everything like decision engine and input validation etc
thats all for day 1.
